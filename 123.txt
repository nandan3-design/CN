üß© OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

üî∑The OSI model is a 7-layer framework developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It standardizes how different networking devices and applications communicate over a network. Though it's theoretical, it helps understand how data flows in a network and how different layers interact.

                                                        7 Layers of the OSI Model (Top to Bottom):

1]Application Layer (Layer 7):
This is the layer closest to the user. It interacts with software applications to implement communication (e.g., browsers, email). Protocols include HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.

2]Presentation Layer (Layer 6):
Responsible for translating data into a format the application can understand. It handles data encoding, encryption/decryption, and compression.

3]Session Layer (Layer 5):
Manages sessions between applications. It controls the start, management, and termination of communication sessions.

4]Transport Layer (Layer 4):
Ensures end-to-end communication and error recovery. Protocols like TCP (reliable) and UDP (faster, no guarantee) work here.

5]Network Layer (Layer 3):
Deals with routing and logical addressing. It determines the best physical path for data using protocols like IP, ICMP.

Data Link Layer (Layer 2):
Provides node-to-node data transfer and handles MAC addressing and error detection. Example protocols: Ethernet, PPP.

6]Physical Layer (Layer 1):
The lowest layer, it transmits raw bits over a physical medium (like cables, switches). It defines voltages, pin layouts, and data rates.



üåê TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)

üî∑The TCP/IP model is a 4-layer model used to design and implement the internet. It is a practical and simplified version of OSI and is the foundation of how the internet operates.

                                                       4 Layers of the TCP/IP Model (Top to Bottom):

1]Application Layer:
Combines OSI's top three layers (Application, Presentation, Session). It handles all high-level protocols, such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS, and enables data exchange between applications.

2]Transport Layer:
Manages reliable or unreliable data delivery between hosts. Protocols like TCP (for reliability) and UDP (for speed) operate here. It ensures data integrity, sequencing, and flow control.

3]Internet Layer:
Equivalent to OSI‚Äôs Network layer. It defines IP addressing, packet routing, and logical addressing. Key protocols include IP, ICMP, ARP.

4]Network Access Layer (Link Layer):
Merges OSI's Data Link and Physical layers. It handles hardware addressing (MAC) and physical transmission of data over media like Ethernet, Wi-Fi.
